# TensorSharp project status

This page keeps repository-level status and longer explanations that do not belong in the README.

## Current direction

TensorSharp is a native .NET 10 inference engine for GGUF models. The current source includes CLI, server/Web UI, compatible HTTP APIs, AgentHost, and the TensorAgent iOS/iPadOS application. AgentHost and TensorAgent are source-first capabilities: the latest tagged release may not contain them yet.

### TensorAgent and iOS

TensorAgent is a .NET MAUI iOS/iPadOS application that runs the TensorSharp engine locally. It links the native GGML library as an iOS `.xcframework`, uses `ggml_metal` on physical devices, and shares the host-neutral chat pipeline with the CLI and server. The iOS target is enabled with `TensorSharpIosTargets=true`; it is not a separate numerical backend or a remote inference service.

The app includes on-device model downloads, saved conversations, attachments, dictation, Agent Skills, and bounded in-process agent tools. iOS does not support ASP.NET Core runtime hosting or child processes, so TensorAgent uses an in-process loopback server and runtime-backed shell/Python/JavaScript integrations. See the [TensorAgent README](../TensorAgent/README.md) for build, simulator, packaging, and test instructions.

## Make It Fast

The short version is:

1. Pick a step-distilled checkpoint for Wan, or the Lightning LoRA for Qwen-Image-Edit.
2. Match the backend to the hardware: `ggml_cuda` for NVIDIA, `ggml_metal` for Apple Silicon and iOS, and `ggml_cpu` for native CPU.
3. Reduce resolution, frame count, or diffusion steps before changing advanced flags. MiniMax-H3's practical point is `--cfg 1.0` with 4–8 steps.
4. For text workloads, try speculative decoding, CPU MoE offload, or `--tp N` only when the model and workload benefit.

For measurements and caveats, read the [engine comparison report](engine_comparison_report.md), [model cards](models/README.md), [feature guide](../FEATURES.md), and [environment-variable matrix](env_var_feature_matrix.md).
