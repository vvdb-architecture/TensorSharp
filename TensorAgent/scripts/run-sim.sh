#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Installs and launches the simulator build of TensorAgent on an iOS simulator
# and streams the app's stdout (the loopback URL, the engine probe, request log)
# to this terminal. Build first with build-sim.sh.
#
# Env:
#   CONFIGURATION   Debug (default) | Release - must match build-sim.sh
#   SIM_UDID        simulator to use (default: iPhone 17 Pro, iOS 26.5 on this Mac)
#   SIM_NAME        used to look the UDID up when SIM_UDID is unset
#   TENSORAGENT_USE_MODEL     Debug builds only: catalog id to load at launch, as
#                   tapping "Use" on the model list would.
#   TENSORAGENT_UI_CHECK=1    Debug builds only: run the composer's gesture checks in
#                   the WebView and log one 'uicheck' line per assertion.
#   TENSORAGENT_SHARE_CHECK=1 Debug builds only: write a page + image into the App
#                   Group inbox, import it, and verify the real WebView applied and
#                   retained it without sending, then explicitly discarded both the
#                   durable envelope and staged attachment.
#   TENSORAGENT_DEMO_PROMPT   Debug builds only: once the Web UI has loaded the app
#                   types this prompt into the composer and sends it, so the
#                   canned /api/chat stream renders on screen without anyone
#                   tapping the simulator (simctl cannot type into a WebView).
#   TENSORAGENT_BACKGROUND_CHECK=1  Debug builds only: ask the loaded model for a long
#                   answer and report, one 'bgcheck' line at a time, what becomes of it
#                   when the app is sent to the background and brought back. Pair it
#                   with verify-background.sh, which does the sending and the reading.
