#
# Two things that silently break a fresh clone are handled here:
#   1. Only the user-local ~/.dotnet SDK carries the maui-ios workload; the
#      system dotnet fails restore with NETSDK1147 (see README.md).
#   2. TensorSharp.GGML.Native/build-ios/GgmlOps.xcframework is gitignored, so it
#      is built on demand (~4 min the first time; ExternalProjects/ggml must
#      already be checked out - the fetch is skipped, never run from here).
#
# Env:
#   CONFIGURATION   Debug (default) | Release
#   TENSORAGENT_REBUILD_XCFRAMEWORK=1   force build-ios.sh even if the xcframework exists

# restore resolves the referenced project's target frameworks before a ProjectReference's
# AdditionalProperties are applied. Without it, restore writes an assets file with no iOS
# target and the build fails with NETSDK1005. Several referenced projects intentionally
# share one output directory; embedding the independently built extension can otherwise
# make two MSBuild nodes race while writing the same deps.json. Keep this single-node for
