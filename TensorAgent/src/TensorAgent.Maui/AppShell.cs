/// One place, and four screens that sit on top of it.

/// <para>
/// The chat is the shell's ONLY content. The saved chats, the model list, the settings
/// and the about page are pushed over it and popped off again, rather than being
/// sibling items the shell switches between — and that is not a matter of taste.
/// Switching top-level items tears the page down: the shell renderer disposes the
/// outgoing item's renderer, which disconnects the page's handler and removes its view
/// controller. Pushing does none of that; the chat stays in the stack with its handler
/// intact, so it comes back instantly and with its state.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// What pushing does NOT buy, and no navigation shape here can, is keeping the WebView
/// running. UIKit takes a covered view controller's view out of the window, WebKit drops
/// the foreground assertion for a WKWebView whose window is nil, and the content process
/// is suspended — mid-answer. That is why the generation cannot belong to the page at
/// all: it belongs to <see cref="Core.Sessions.ChatTurnManager"/>, and the page attaches
/// to it again on the way back. This class only makes sure there is a page to come back
/// to.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The flyout is gone with it. The page has its own menu now — a drawer from the left
/// edge that also lists the saved chats — and two menus for the same five destinations
/// is one more than a phone screen can justify.
