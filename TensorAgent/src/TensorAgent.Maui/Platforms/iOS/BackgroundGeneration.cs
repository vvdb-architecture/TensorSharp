/// <summary>
/// Keeps a generation alive across the three things that used to end it: the display
/// going to sleep, the user leaving the app, and — the one that actually broke answers —
/// the GPU being taken away while the app is not in front.
///
/// <para>
/// The fourth, leaving the chat for another screen, is <see cref="ChatTurnManager"/>'s
/// job and needs nothing from iOS. These are the ones only the platform can answer. A
/// phone dims and then locks after a minute or two of no touches, and a locked phone
/// suspends the app; a turn that takes ninety seconds is therefore routinely killed by
/// the user doing nothing at all. Switching to another app suspends it immediately.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// THE GPU. An app that is not frontmost may not submit Metal work — no entitlement
/// grants it, and there is no background mode for compute. A command buffer committed
/// anyway comes back <c>MTLCommandBufferStatusError</c> with "Insufficient Permission (to
/// submit GPU work from background)", and ggml-metal's answer to that is a sticky flag:
/// "once set, graph_compute will return GGML_STATUS_FAILED until the backend is
/// recreated". So switching away mid-answer did not lose a token, it lost the model —
/// that turn failed and so did every message after it, for the life of the process.
/// That is the bug this class now exists for more than any other.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The fix is to stop submitting rather than to submit and fail, and the moment to stop
/// is <c>WillResignActive</c>, NOT <c>DidEnterBackground</c>: resign arrives while the
/// app is still frontmost and several hundred milliseconds of animation before the
/// background transition, which is far longer than the decode step that would otherwise
/// have been in flight when the GPU was withdrawn. Coming back is
/// <c>DidBecomeActive</c>. The pair also covers the transient interruptions — Control
/// Centre, an incoming call banner, the app switcher — where the app never backgrounds
/// at all; a generation pauses for as long as the sheet is up and then carries on, which
/// is both correct and unnoticeable.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// It follows the HOST's turns rather than the page's idea of them, which is the whole
/// reason it can be written at all: the page stops reading whenever it is navigated
/// away from, and asking it whether the model is working would answer "no" at exactly
/// the moments this exists for.
