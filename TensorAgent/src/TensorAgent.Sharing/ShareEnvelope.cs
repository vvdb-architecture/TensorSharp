/// <para>
/// Two processes, no lock. The extension is started by iOS inside whatever app the
/// user was in, writes an envelope and dies; the app reads it, perhaps seconds later,
/// perhaps after a launch. They never overlap on one envelope, but they can easily
/// overlap on the DIRECTORY, and the app must never see a half-written share — a
/// <c>share.json</c> that names three files while the third is still being copied is
/// exactly the kind of failure that reproduces once a week and never in a test.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// So writing is two-phase and finishes with a rename. Everything is written under
/// <c>&lt;id&gt;.partial</c>, and the last thing the extension does is rename that
/// directory to <c>&lt;id&gt;</c>. A rename within one filesystem is atomic, so an
/// envelope is either absent or complete, and a partial directory left behind by an
/// extension the system killed mid-copy is visibly not an envelope. The reader claims
/// one by renaming again, to <c>&lt;id&gt;.claimed</c>, so two readers racing for the
/// same share cannot both get it: the loser's rename fails.
/// </para>
