// What Safari runs inside the page when the user shares it into TensorAgent.
//
// This file is the single biggest quality difference in the whole feature, and the
// reason is simple: without it a browser hands a share extension a URL and nothing
// else, so a model running entirely on the phone -- with no way to fetch that URL --
// can say nothing about the page at all. With it, the extension receives the article's
// text, its title and whatever the reader had selected, and the answer is about the
// thing the user was actually looking at.
//
// Only Safari runs it. Chrome, Edge and Firefox construct their share item eagerly
// from the URL with no page access, so they deliver public.url and the extension falls
// back to sharing the link (see ShareItemReader). That is not a bug to work around; it
// is what those browsers vend.
//
// The contract, which is unforgiving:
//   * a GLOBAL named exactly ExtensionPreprocessingJS, holding an INSTANCE,
//   * whose prototype has run(arguments), which must call arguments.completionFunction
//     with a dictionary,
//   * the file must be a bundle RESOURCE of the extension, and
//   * NSExtensionJavaScriptPreprocessingFile names it WITHOUT the .js extension.
// Get any of those wrong and nothing happens, with no error anywhere.
//
// It must also be defensive to the point of paranoia: it runs inside somebody else's
// page, where document.title can be missing, getSelection can throw inside a
// cross-origin frame, and an exception here means the share silently produces nothing.
// ============================================================================

// element that looks most like the article, take its innerText, and fall back to the
