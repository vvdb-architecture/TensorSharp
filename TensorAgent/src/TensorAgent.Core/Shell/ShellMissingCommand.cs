/// "bc: command not found" is a true sentence and a dead end, and a dead end is where a
/// model stops using the shell. Observed on a phone: asked for the days between two
/// dates, the model correctly reached for the shell, correctly got one date's epoch
/// seconds out of it, then reached for <c>bc</c> to do the subtraction, was told 127,
/// and finished the job in its own head — arriving at 164 days instead of 20,863 and
/// presenting it with a formula. Nothing in the output suggested a next move, so it
/// made one up.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The usual answer to a missing program is to install it, and here that is not
/// available to anybody: iOS runs no child processes and will not execute a binary that
/// was not signed into the app bundle, so there is no package manager to reach for and
/// no <c>bc</c> to fetch. What IS available is a full CPython and a JavaScript engine,
/// either of which does everything the missing tool would have. When the user has
/// allowed the network, CPython can also add libraries that ship as pure-Python wheels;
/// JavaScript packages and native dependencies cannot be added. So the message names
/// the thing that works instead of the thing that does not exist, which is the difference
/// between a model that recovers in one round and a model that gives up.
