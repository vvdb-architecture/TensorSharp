/// <summary>
/// The built-in model list. Downloadable entries' sizes and hashes were read from the
/// Hugging Face tree API (LFS object ids) on 2026-09-01, so a download is verified
/// against the exact bytes the publisher uploaded. A sideload-only entry carries the
/// same immutable size/hash identity but deliberately no URL when its GGUF embeds no
/// publisher repository; the app verifies a user-selected local file instead.
///
/// <para>
/// Sizing rule (why these quantizations): on GGML Metal the quantized weights are wrapped
/// as MTLBuffers straight over the GGUF mmap, and Metal keeps those pages resident, so
/// the resident set is about the file size plus the KV cache, the projector (materialised
/// as F32, so roughly twice its file size) and ~0.5 GB of compute buffers. An iPhone with
/// 12 GB grants an app with the increased-memory entitlement roughly 8.5 GB, which is why
/// the 12 GB tier tops out around 7.5 GB of weights and everything larger is offered only
/// to 16 GB iPads.
