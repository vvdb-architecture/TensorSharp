/// <summary>
/// The machinery around the tool surface that survives a change OF that surface:
/// partitioning a caller's tools from this host's, the per-language install ledger, the
/// PATH plumbing an environment needs, reading a failure well enough to act on it, and
/// what does not count as a produced file.
///
/// <para>
/// The declare/classify/dispatch sweep this file was named for now lives in
/// <c>ShellToolDeclarationTests</c>, which owns the current two-tool surface. What is
/// left here is everything that was never about WHICH tools are declared — and which
/// therefore has to keep working across exactly the kind of rewrite that just happened.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The incident the sweep exists for is worth keeping written down, because it is the
/// reason both files exist: <c>apply_patch</c> and <c>list_files</c> were once declared
/// to the model and implemented by the adapter, while the hand-maintained predicate in
/// <see cref="SkillTools.IsBuiltInTool"/> never learned their names. Every call to
/// either was classified as the CLIENT's, handed to a Web UI that declares no tools and
/// has no handler for a tool-call frame at all, and the turn ended. The model's whole
/// reply had been inside its thinking channel, so the user saw a chat that answered once
/// and then stopped — nothing logged, nothing rendered, every retry hitting the same
/// wall. A name being right everywhere it appeared is not enough; what was missing was a
/// name in a place it did not appear at all, which only a sweep over the DECLARED set
/// can see.
