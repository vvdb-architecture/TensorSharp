    /// iteration) or by the standalone <c>SpeculativeDecoder</c> in
    /// TensorSharp.Models (which owns its own generate loop).
    ///
    /// Per step:
    ///   1. DRAFT: <see cref="ISpeculator.Propose"/> proposes up to
    ///      <see cref="MaxDraftTokens"/> tokens. This class does not know or
    ///      care how - a chained NextN head, a one-pass block drafter, an
    ///      n-gram lookup over the context, or something not written yet.
    ///   2. VERIFY: the trunk forwards [lastToken, d1..dK] as ONE batch with
    ///      per-row logits; the caller's <c>drawNext</c> draws each row with the
    ///      request's own sampler and drafts are accepted while the drawn token
    ///      matches; row m's drawn token is the corrected/bonus token for free.
    ///   3. ROLLBACK: on partial acceptance the recurrent (GDN) state is
    ///      restored from a pre-verify snapshot and re-advanced over the kept
    ///      prefix; attention KV only needs a position rewind. Trunks whose
    ///      verify already persisted usable KV skip the re-forward entirely.
    ///   4. COMMIT: kept tokens are handed back to the speculator with their
    ///      exact trunk hidden states, so a learned drafter's KV cache tracks
    ///      the real context and a lookup drafter's corpus tracks the real
    ///      output.
    ///
    /// WHY THE OUTPUT CANNOT CHANGE: every emitted token is drawn by the
    /// CALLER's sampler from a TRUNK row. The draft only decides whether that
    /// row had already been computed. A wrong draft costs a rollback, never a
    /// wrong token, which is why <see cref="ISpeculator"/> carries no
    /// correctness obligations at all.
