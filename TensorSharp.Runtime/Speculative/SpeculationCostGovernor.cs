    /// half a trunk step per drafted token, and measured end to end at every
    /// window size from 1 to 15 it ran 18-31% SLOWER than plain greedy despite a
    /// 70% acceptance rate. Acceptance rate alone cannot see that: it says
    /// nothing about what a draft COSTS relative to the trunk.
    ///
    /// So measure both and let the numbers decide. A round measures speculation
    /// first (so the very first decode step still speculates), then takes a
